        <p className="text-[#cacaca] mt-4 text-[16px] leading-6">
       My coding journey began in high school when I stumbled upon a game development club. That's when I realized that games such as Doodle Jump and Flappy Bird, which I played on my phone often, can be created by someone simply with a laptop and a good internet connection. During my time in the club, I dove into the complexities of programming <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">2D games in Java</span>, grasping concepts like <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">motion physics</span> and <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">geometry</span>. This discovery motivated me to pursue a major in <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">computer science</span> to delve deeper into the world of programming.

        <p className="text-[#cacaca]  mt-4 mb-8 text-[16px] leading-6">During my second year of college, I also enrolled into a full stack coding bootcamp. This  program enhanced my understanding of web development and allowed me to master advanced framworks and tools, including <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">React.js</span> in the front-end and <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">Node.js</span> for back-end services. I also learned to efficiently manage application assets and modules using <span className="font-bold text-[#54d5bb]">Webpack</span>, These key skills now enable me to develop complex, performant, and user-centric web applications, such as an eCommerce platform and social media applcation.</p>
        <p className="text-[#cacaca]  mt-4 mb-8 text-[16px] leading-6">Beyond coding, I am also an active skateboarder. One of my favorite things to do before a coding session is to hit up my local skatepark and clear my mind with some excercise</p>
